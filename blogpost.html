<h2> We're Screwed </h2>
<h3>By Jaseam S.</h3>

<p> Today i watch this documentary on youtube called "Humans Dont Apply" which that exposed the growth of robot life. Physical Labor, Auto Mobiles, and Creative Bots were spoken about throughout the video. When it came to physical labor, general purpose computers was the first thing mentioned. These machines have already replaced human in factories and have taken over the basic jobs originally ment for humans. Auto Mobiles, mainly related to self-driving cars.
Self- driving cars are already on the road causing no casualties on the road compared to the 40,000 lives taken by humans in a year. Creative bots are learning everyday from human activity and are learning to have mindsets like humans.</p>

<p> I my opinion robots will be the deah of humans.Im honestly super scared about the uprise of robots. I feel that slowly the robots are taking over the life of humans and it is no longer a fiction matter. I really hope that before bots take over that i have lived such a wonderful life and have died. Although i feel bad for my kids and grandchildern because they will suffer and live in a robot's world. Siri was the just a little taste of what the world is coming to and i dont wanna be here to see how the human race ends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

		<h3> "Smile While We Snap" </h3>
		<p> In this text, I got the message that phones are always in the right hands at the right time. People have gotten so quick at snatching their phones out there pocket and capturing every eye-catching moment of the day. Fights, people singing and even people dancers on the train. We've been able to document so many positive and negative moments within seconds. In addition, these moments are even captured and posted to social media and other popular web pages for many people to see. As it was stated in the text "Digital cameras encode metadata along with the image." So many ways to capture things at many different speeds. Shutter, aperture and it can be done with a variety of cameras such as the Canon Rebel or Kodak and even Nikon. </p>

		<h3> How Technology Has Changed ? </h3>
		<p class="jahlines"> Jaseam: How old were you when you got your first computer?

</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: I was 50 years old. </p>
		<p class="jahlines"> Jaseam: What was your favorite piece of technology growing up?</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: It was television.</p>
        <p class="jahlines"> 
         Jaseam: How has technology changed over your lifetime?
</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: We got a TV when I was four years old. The phone in my house have no dial, You had to pick it up and an operator would answer to transfer your phone call to somebody else. You had to share phone lines with your neighbors.  There is always a fight to use the phone. TVs were black and white, Color came when I was 10 years old. The TV would go on air at 7 AM and go off air at 11 PM. There were no computers and no cell phones at this time. </p>
        <p class="jahlines"> Jaseam: Has the change in technology youâ€™ve seen over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt our society?
</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: Itâ€™s a mixed bag. On one hand having phones make you feel safer being alone. on the other hand it allows people to do mediocre jobs. You can use Photoshop and be ok but does that make you a visual artist? It makes your one bad job ok.</p>
        <p class="jahlines"> 
Jaseam: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?
</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: Driverless carsâ€¦.The email thing is phenomenal and it makes it life easier.
</p>
        <p class="jahlines"> Jaseam: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?
</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: Technology Increasingly has its mind of its own, and that concerns me. Fake news is increasing and anyone can be a news reporter, and news then becomes less reliable.
</p>
        <p class="jahlines"> 
Jaseam: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?
</p>
        <p class="allenlines"> Allen: Donâ€™t be to reliable on machines. Machines always fail so donâ€™t be too reliant.</p>
        <p class="jahlines"> Jaseam: If you could create any form of technology what would be?</p>
        <p class="allenlines">  Allen: A source of completely clean energy.</p>
